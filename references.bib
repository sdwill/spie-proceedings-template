	Abstract = {
Direct imaging is in general necessary to characterize exoplanets and disks. A coronagraph is an instrument used to create a dim (high-contrast) region in a star's PSF where faint companions can be detected. All coronagraphic high-contrast imaging systems use one or more deformable mirrors (DMs) to correct quasi-static aberrations and recover contrast in the focal plane. Simulations show that existing wavefront control algorithms can correct for diffracted starlight in just a few iterations, but in practice tens or hundreds of control iterations are needed to achieve high contrast. The discrepancy largely arises from the fact that simulations have perfect knowledge of the wavefront and DM actuation. Thus, wavefront correction algorithms are currently limited by the quality and speed of wavefront estimates. Exposures in space will take orders of magnitude more time than any calculations, so a nonlinear estimation method that needs fewer images but more computational time would be advantageous. In addition, current wavefront correction routines seek only to reduce diffracted starlight. Here we present nonlinear estimation algorithms that include optimal estimation of sources incoherent with a star such as exoplanets and debris disks.

Accurate knowledge of the illumination angles is necessary for good image quality; hence, calibration methods are crucial, despite often being impractical or slow. Here, we propose a fast, robust, and accurate self-calibration algorithm that uses only experimentally collected data and general knowledge of the illumination setup. First, our algorithm makes a fast direct estimate of the brightfield illumination angles based on image processing. Then, a more computationally intensive spectral correlation method is used inside the iterative solver to further refine the angle estimates of both brightfield and darkfield images. We demonstrate our method for correcting large and small misalignment artifacts in 2D and 3D Fourier ptychography with different source types: an LED array, a galvo-steered laser, and a high-NA quasi-dome LED illuminator.}},

By capturing a stack of low-resolution images under different illumination angles, an inverse algorithm can be used to computationally reconstruct the high-resolution complex field. Here, we compare and classify multiple proposed inverse algorithms in terms of experimental robustness. We find that the main sources of error are noise, aberrations and mis-calibration (i.e. model mis-match). Using simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the choice of cost function plays a critical role, with amplitude-based cost functions performing better than intensity-based ones. The reason for this is that Fourier ptychography datasets consist of images from both brightfield and darkfield illumination, representing a large range of measured intensities. Both noise (e.g. Poisson noise) and model mis-match errors are shown to scale with intensity. Hence, algorithms that use an appropriate cost function will be more tolerant to both noise and model mis-match. Given these insights, we propose a global Newton’s method algorithm which is robust and accurate. Finally, we discuss the impact of procedures for algorithmic correction of aberrations and mis-calibration.}},

It employs a sequence of low-resolution images captured under angularly varying illumination and applies the phase retrieval algorithm to iteratively reconstruct a wide-field, high-resolution image. In current FPM imaging system, system uncertainties, such as the pupil aberration of the employed optics, may significantly degrade the quality of the reconstruction. In this paper, we develop and test a nonlinear optimization algorithm to improve the robustness of the FPM imaging system by simultaneously considering the reconstruction and the system imperfections. Analytical expressions for the gradient of a squared-error metric with respect to the object and illumination allow joint optimization of the object and system parameters. The algorithm achieves superior reconstructions when the system parameters are inaccurately known or in the presence of noise and corrects the pupil aberrations simultaneously. Experiments on both synthetic and real captured data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

abstract = {{Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is a newly proposed computational imaging method aimed at reconstructing a high-resolution wide-field image from a sequence of low-resolution images. These low-resolution images are captured under varied illumination angles and the FPM recovery routine then stitches them together in the Fourier domain iteratively. Although FPM has achieved success with static sample reconstructions, the long acquisition time inhibits real-time application. To address this problem, we propose here a self-learning based FPM which accelerates the acquisition and reconstruction procedure. We first capture a single image under normally incident illumination, and then use it to simulate the corresponding low-resolution images under other illumination angles. The simulation is based on the relationship between the illumination angles and the shift of the sample’s spectrum. We analyze the importance of the simulated low-resolution images in order to devise a selection scheme which only collects the ones with higher importance. The measurements are then captured with the selection scheme and employed to perform the FPM reconstruction. Since only measurements of high importance are captured, the time requirements of data collection as well as image reconstruction can be greatly reduced. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method with simulation and experimental results showing that the reduction ratio of data size requirements can reach over 70\%, without sacrificing image reconstruction quality.}},

A series of milestones were set to track the development of the technologies required for the instrument; we report on completion of WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph milestone 2—a narrowband 10−8 contrast test with static aberrations for the shaped pupil—and the plans for the upcoming broadband coronagraph milestone 5.}},
